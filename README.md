# Introduction 

Quix Companion App is a mobile application developed by Quix to stream telemetry data such as speed, location, battery level from mobile phones to Quix workspaces. Quix Companion App is intended for simulating real-time acquisition and streaming of telemetry data and testing prototypes on Quix.

# Getting Started

Quix Companion App is available for download on Google Play Store. In order to use the app, you need to pair it with a Quix workspace.
